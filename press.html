              <br><br>
              <h4>Finally!</h4>
              <p>We did it. Oueve was submitted and approved for the app store on February 9th, 2019. </p>
              <br>
              <p>3 Years ago, we set up to create and develop the best water tracking app for iOS. We really could not have gotten to this state without our supporters, testers, and the community we created. With over 3 years of development, we added features that made Oueve smarter like Smart Notifications and the Oueve Assistant.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Even though we've published the app, we have lots to do to improve the app. There's still countless ways we can improve Oueve and make it the best water tracking app on the app store.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Thank you to all of our supporters over the years and we hope to do more in the future!</p>

          <h3>Recap of 2018</h3>
            <small>Published in Newsletter</small>
              <br><br>
              <h4>Happy Holidays!</h4>
              <p>2018 has been monumental for Oueve. We've taken huge steps towards release, starting with additions to our website, Facebook page and, Instagram page. In hopes to improve transparency, we've provided more updates on our platforms and introduced a Newsletter to provide updates to our supporters. We've also created a Changelog to document our progress and a Press Release page to archive our previous releases. We hope to continue to use these channels to provide as much information of our progress to our users. This will allow us to look back on each incremental update and see how Oueve has changed overtime. </p>
              <br>
              <p>Furthermore with more than 20 beta releases, we've added more features and improvements to improve the functionality of the app. We've also redesigned each element and improved the memory and CPU consumption of the app. Additionally, we have also added User Notifications, Oueve Assistant, Oueve Rings, Edit Presets, and Data Sorting to improve user experience. These features were commonly requested and tested by our beta testing community. Without the support of our beta testers, we wouldn't be anywhere near where we are. Their continual support has improved Oueve and as a community we have taken these steps together towards releasing Oueve.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Although we have accomplished so much in 2018, these steps indicate the potential that can be accomplished in 2019. We cant thank our supporters enough and we're proud of what we have done. Thanks again!</p>
              <br>
              <p style="text-align: left">Happy 2019,<br>The Oueve Team</p>

              <h4>Hello Beta Testers!</h4>
              <p>Thank you all for testing Oueve! After a month of internal testing for notifications, we've rewritten notifications to include new features and improvements that we'll hope that you'll like.<br><br>We've also escalated the version number of Oueve to 1.1 to mark that all elements of the app have been redesigned or rewritten. Starting with beta v0.12, we aimed to improve all of the original code and graphics and inch closer to release. After several beta releases, v0.13 introduced UI improvements for the Data and Home Screen to help visibility and provide more useful data to the user. In beta v0.16, we introduced redesigns for the how notifications worked and improved the whole system with Snooze, Repeat, Auto-Add, and Quick-Add options and increased the version to v1.1. We're very close to release, but we still need your help so keep sending us feedback!</p>

            <small>Published by Derek Lee</small>
              <br><br>
              <h4>Hey!</h4>
              <p>We know we may have let you down recently. Initially, we planned to release Oueve with basic features through beta testing and slowly expand the feature base. However as we added more features, we found it hard to release a early release candidate of Oueve through beta testing channels. So over the last two years behind the scenes, we added more technical features allowing our user to keep track of their water consumption. We also spent the last two years improving the science behind Oueve, increasing the accuracy of the recommendations that our app could provide.<br><br>The trust that we intially built, connecting over 300 users, has been tested, but we are certain that we can finally release Oueve. In the future, we plan to continually update Oueve with regular software updates that include new and easier ways to track your water consumption.</p>
